# Ex1_OOP
offline algorithm for the elevator allocation problem.
This project is written in python. Our algorithm is fairly simple, but might have bad results.
further discovery and research is needed to complete this project efficiently.
With this in mind we still try to make our best implementation as an opening move with the ideology
of exploring different implementations.

TO RUN THIS make sure you have the following files on your pc:
Calls_a.csv, Calls_b.csv, Calls_c.csv, Calls.d.csv, B1.json, B2.json, B3.json, B4.json, B5.json
(These files can be found in          OOP_2021-main\Assignments\Ex1\data\Ex1_input\Ex1_Buildings,         OOP_2021-main\Assignments\Ex1\data\Ex1_input\Ex1_Calls)
and change the path specified in Ex1.py-getCallCase(), and Ex1.py-getBuildingCase() to those files directory
