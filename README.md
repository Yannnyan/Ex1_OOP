# Ex1_OOP
offline algorithm for the elevator allocation problem
This project is written in python. Our algorithm is fairly simple, but might have bad results.
further discovery and research is needed to complete this project efficiently. With this in mind we 
still try to make our best implementation as an opening move with the ideology of exploring different implementations.
